🚫 Current Compatibility Gap
-
Unity Version	PureHarmony Status	Key Issues
-
Unity 6 (6000.0.53f1)	❌ Not Supported	• Different native plugin API
-
• Updated graphics pipeline

• New Vulkan/IL2CPP changes

Unity 2022 LTS	✅ Target Support	• Stable native interfaces

• Proven plugin system

• Mature IL2CPP

Unity 2021 LTS	✅ Primary Target	• Maximum compatibility

• Broad device support

• Well-documented APIs

🔧 Technical Barriers with Unity 6
1. Native Plugin Interface Changes
csharp
// Unity 6 likely has updated native plugin interfaces
// Current PureHarmony uses Unity 2022 LTS patterns:
[DllImport("unity.bridge")]
public static extern void UnityHarmony_Initialize();

// Unity 6 may require:
[DllImport("unity.bridge", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
public static extern unsafe void UnityHarmony_InitializeV2(IntPtr config);
2. Graphics Pipeline Updates
Unity 6 introduces significant rendering changes:

New Vulkan requirements (1.3+ features)

Enhanced SRP (Scriptable Render Pipeline) changes

Different shader compilation targets

Updated EGL/Vulkan context management

3. IL2CPP & Burst Compiler Evolution
cpp
// Unity 6's IL2CPP may generate different native interfaces
// Current bridge expects Unity 2022 LTS ABI compatibility
extern "C" {
    void UNITY_INTERFACE_EXPORT UNITY_INTERFACE_API 
    UnityPluginLoad(IUnityInterfaces* unityInterfaces);
    
    // Unity 6 may change this interface
}
🗓️ Realistic Timeline
Phase 1: Foundation (Now)
✅ Unity 2021/2022 LTS support

✅ Basic HarmonyOS graphics/input

✅ AppGallery deployment pipeline

Phase 2: Unity 6 Support (Q2 2026)
🔄 Unity 6 native plugin adaptation

🔄 Updated graphics bridge for new Vulkan features

🔄 IL2CPP compatibility testing

Phase 3: Advanced Features (2026+)
◻️ Unity 6 DOTS/ECS optimization

◻️ Enhanced XEngine integration

◻️ Cloud build services

🎯 Recommended Approach
For Current Projects:
bash
# Downgrade to Unity 2022.3 LTS for HarmonyOS support
Unity Hub → Install Unity 2022.3.xxf1 → Import PureHarmony
For New Projects:
bash
# Start with Unity 2022 LTS + PureHarmony
# Plan Unity 6 upgrade after PureHarmony v2.0
Migration Strategy:
Develop in Unity 2022 LTS with PureHarmony

Port to HarmonyOS and validate performance

Upgrade to Unity 6 once PureHarmony supports it

Optimize using Unity 6-specific features

🔍 Checking Your Project's Compatibility
------------------
csharp
// Add this to your project to check compatibility
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````
public class HarmonyOSCompatibilityCheck : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        #if !UNITY_2022_3_OR_NEWER || UNITY_6000_OR_NEWER
        Debug.LogError("PureHarmony requires Unity 2022 LTS. " +
                      "Unity 6 support coming in 2026.");
        #else
        Debug.Log("Project compatible with PureHarmony!");
        #endif
    }
}

💡 Bottom Line
Wait for PureHarmony v2.0 if you require Unity 6 features. For immediate HarmonyOS deployment, use Unity 2022 LTS.

The PureHarmony team is actively monitoring Unity 6 changes and will release compatibility updates as the ecosystem stabilizes. Check the PureHarmony Roadmap for the latest Unity 6 support timeline.
